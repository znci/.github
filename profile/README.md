## Our Projects
Here are some of the projects we're working on right now!
* 🚀 [Rocket](https://github.com/znci/rocket) is a Minecraft plguin that allows users to easily write their own scripts in Lua to customize their servers.
* 🧵 [Twine](https://github.com/znci/twine) is a wrapper around LuaJ that makes the API less cumbersome to use. It is a critical component of Rocket.
* 🥭 Mango is a in development project that makes it easier for users to make their own Minecarft servers they have full access to and join them to the Mango network.
